# Farm-Analyzer
EC 500 Project on Farm Analyzer. We are developing an andriod application to access and analyze ndvi images obtained. 
This application provides following features:- 
- Stores all media captured in every location of the farm.
- Retrieves the information based on the location.
- Compares media captured in different times.
- Provides APIs or services to integrate into third party applications to upload or download media.

# NDVI
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). NDVI always ranges from -1 to +1. But there isnâ€™t a distinct boundary for each type of land cover.
